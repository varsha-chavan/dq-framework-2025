        Steps:
            1. collect the rows of plans from dataframe
            2. create the list of tuples of execution plans available for entity.
                The rule_id, column_name, paramaters, is_critical, etc. will be fetched in the list.
            3. store the result in a list of tuples

        Output :
            list: A list of tuples of plan info e.g. execution_plan_list[(rule_id, column_name, paramaters, is_critical, etc.)]
